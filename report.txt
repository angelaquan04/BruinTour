 GeoDatabase
load()  
* If N is the number of lines in mapdata.txt, load() has Big-O of O(N).


get_connected_points()
* If the GeoDatabase holds N GeoPoints and each GeoPoint is associated with P other GeoPoints on average, this method is O(P); 


get_street_name()
* O(1) constant time 


Router: 
route()
* I used A*, i create a struct called pair to hold a GeoPoint and its F value. I used a priority queue to store pairs in, the priority queue prioritizes pairs with smallest F values. Additionally I use a hashmap called previousPoints to map a GeoPoint to the point that comes before it. This map also keeps track of points that Iâ€™ve already visited.
